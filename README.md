# Router Reaper + ARP Spoofer
## Created By Colin Quade and Riley Westerman
A Python project (run on Linux for my class) meant to scan network activity for suspicious activity, primarily ARP Spoofing and large packet sizes.

# About

This project uses the Python library Scapy for sniffing packets and creating packets. There are two scripts involved, one is the actual scanner and the other is a script that creates fake packets and sends them onto the network.
## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  pip install scapy
```
